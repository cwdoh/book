# `mod` and the filesystem

Every module in Rust starts with the `mod` keyword. Let's give it a try by
making a new project with Cargo called "modules". This time, instead of a
binary, we're going to make a library: a project that other people would pull
into their projects as a dependency to get the functionality we provided, like
we used the `rand` crate in Chapter 2. So we're not going to use the `--bin`
option like we have before, instead run:

```bash
$ cargo new modules
$ cd modules
```

You'll notice that Cargo generated `src/lib.rs` instead of `src/main.rs` for
us, and inside it we'll find this:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
    }
}
```

This is an empty test to help us get our library started, instead of the binary
that says "Hello, world!" that we get with a new binary. Let's ignore the `#[]` stuff and `mod tests` for a little bit, but leave it at the end of `src/lib.rs`. Let's imagine that we're creating a library to provide networking functionality. At the beginning of the file, add:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
```

This is our first module declaration. As you can see, you use the `mod`
keyword, followed by the name of the module, and then a block of code in curly
braces. Everything inside this block is inside the namespace `network`. In this
case, we have a single function, `connect`. If we wanted to try and call this
function from outside the `network` module, we would say `network::connect`
rather than `connect`.

You could have multiple modules, side-by-side. For example, if you wanted a
`client` module:

```rust
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }
}

mod client {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
```

Now we have a `network::connect` function and a `client::connect` function.

And you can put modules inside of modules, if you wanted to have `client` to be
within `network`:

```rust
mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod client {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
```

This gives us `network::connect` and `network::client::connect`.

In this way, modules form a tree. The contents of `src/lib.rs` are at the root
of the project's tree, and the submodules form the leaves. Here's what our
first example looks like when thought of this way:

```text
modules
 ├── network
 └── client
```

And here's the second:

```text
modules
 └── network
     └── client
```

More complicated projects can have a lot of modules.

## Putting modules in another file

Modules form a hierarchical, tree-like structure. So does another thing:
file systems! The module system is the way that we split larger Rust projects up
into multiple files. Let's imagine we have a module layout like this:

File: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod client {
    fn connect() {
    }
}

mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod server {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
```

Let's extract the `client` module into another file. First, we need to change
our code in `src/lib.rs`:

File: src/lib.rs

```rust,ignore
mod client;

mod network {
    fn connect() {
    }

    mod server {
        fn connect() {
        }
    }
}
```

We still say `mod client`, but instead of curly braces, we have a semicolon.
This lets Rust know that we have a module, but it's in another file. Which file
is it in? Open up `src/client.rs` and put this in it:

File: src/client.rs

```rust
fn connect() {
}
```

Note that we don't need a `mod` declaration in this file. `mod` is for
declaring a new module, and we've already declared this module in `src/lib.rs`.
This file provides the _contents_ of the `client` module. If we put a `mod
client` here, we'd be giving the `client` module its own submodule named
`client`!

Now, everything should compile:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling modules v0.1.0 (file:///home/steve/tmp/modules)

src/client.rs:1:1: 2:2 warning: function is never used: `connect`,
#[warn(dead_code)] on by default
src/client.rs:1 fn connect() {
               ^
src/lib.rs:4:5: 5:6 warning: function is never used: `connect`,
#[warn(dead_code)] on by default
src/lib.rs:4     fn connect() {
                ^
src/lib.rs:8:9: 9:10 warning: function is never used: `connect`,
#[warn(dead_code)] on by default
src/lib.rs:8         fn connect() {
                    ^
```

Don't worry about those warnings for now; we'll clear them up in a future
section. They're just warnings, we've built things successfully!

Let's convert the `network` module next. Change `src/lib.rs` to look like this:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust,ignore
mod client;

mod network;
```

And then put this in `src/network.rs`

Filename: src/network.rs

```rust
fn connect() {
}

mod server {
    fn connect() {
    }
}
```

And then run `cargo build` again. Success! We have one more module to extract:
`server`. Unfortunately, our current tactic won't work. Let's try it anyway. Modify `src/network.rs` to look like this:

Filename: src/network.rs

```rust,ignore
fn connect() {
}

mod server;
```

Put this in `src/server.rs`

Filename: src/server.rs

```rust
fn connect() {
}
```

When we try to `cargo build`, we'll get an error:

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling modules v0.1.0 (file:///home/steve/tmp/modules)
src/network.rs:4:5: 4:11 error: cannot declare a new module at this location
src/network.rs:4 mod server;
                     ^~~~~~
src/network.rs:4:5: 4:11 note: maybe move this module `network` to its own directory via `network/mod.rs`
src/network.rs:4 mod server;
                     ^~~~~~
src/network.rs:4:5: 4:11 note: ... or maybe `use` the module `server` instead of possibly redeclaring it
src/network.rs:4 mod server;
                     ^~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
error: Could not compile `modules`.
```

This error is actually pretty helpful. It points out something we didn't know
that we could do yet:

> note: maybe move this module `network` to its own directory via
`network/mod.rs`

Here's the problem: in our case, we have different names for our modules:
`client` and `network::server`. But what if we had `client` and
`network::client`? That's completely valid, but then which module is
`src/client.rs` for?

So instead, we can do what the error suggests. We'll make a new directory,
move `src/server.rs` into it, and change `src/network.rs` to `src/network/mod.rs`.
Then, we try to build:

```bash
$ mkdir src/network
$ mv src/server.rs src/network
$ mv src/network.rs src/network/mod.rs
$ cargo build
   Compiling modules v0.1.0 (file:///home/steve/tmp/modules)
<warnings>
$
```

It works! In summary, these are the two rules of modules with regards to files:

* If a module named `foo` has no submodules, it will be named `foo.rs`.
* If a module named `foo` does have submodules, it will be named `foo/mod.rs`.

Next, we'll talk about the `pub` keyword, and get rid of those warnings!
